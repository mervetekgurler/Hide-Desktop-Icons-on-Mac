# Hide and Unhide Desktop Icons on Mac

Welcome to the `Hide-Desktop-Icons-on-Mac` repository! This guide is designed to help you quickly make all the desktop icons on your Mac invisible with just a single click. Whether you're preparing to share your screen in a meeting or simply prefer a cleaner workspace, this simple solution is for you.

I found myself needing a straightforward method to hide all the folders and icons cluttering my desktop during presentations, but I didn't want to spend money on an app for such a basic function. After failing to find a practical tutorial online that met my needs, I decided to create one. This repository not only serves as a guide but also as a personal documentation, in case I ever need to remember how to set this up again.

[Here](https://github.com/mervetekgurler/Hide-Desktop-Icons-on-Mac/blob/main/tutorial.md), you'll find step-by-step instructions on how to create Mac Shortcuts using the Terminal app that allows you to hide and unhide your desktop icons effortlessly. No third-party software requiredâ€”just a couple of shortcuts right in your Menu Bar for easy access.
